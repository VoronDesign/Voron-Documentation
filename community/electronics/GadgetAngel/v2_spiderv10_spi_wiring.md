# Voron V2 - Fysetc Spider V1.1 (TMC2100, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161, TMC5160HV, TMC5160_PRO) Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers for SPI Mode

We have no idea what state your board is in when you start this process.  Someone could have moved jumpers around already.  But since we are here, on the SPI end of the site, then I assume that you might want to look at the next section **before** removing **all the jumpers** because if all the jumpers are already set for SPI mode then removing them and placing them right back in would be a waste of your valuable time.

**If one does not understand what I mean by "if the jumpers are set for SPI" then I would recommend that removing all the jumpers would be the place to start.**

* Remove **all <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW</span>** on-board jumpers, located at the positions shown below:

* __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">NOTE:</span>__ The Fysetc Spider V1.0 board has jumpers located inside the endstop connectors when the board is first unpacked, **remove them**.

## Initial Preparation for SPI Mode - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumpers, located at the positions as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumpers in the diagram below:

## USB-PWR Selection Header and DIAG Headers

* **Set the USB-PWR jumper to the +5V position (as shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>)** to avoid the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard. The top pin on this header is labeled "U5V", and the middle and bottom pins do not have labels, but the Fysetc Spider V1.0 schematic diagram labels the bottom pin as "+5V".  Ensure the USB-PWR jumper is set as shown in the diagram below.

* Ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE box</span>) are removed** because the Voron printer does not use sensorless homing.

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumpers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

## (FAN & PROBE) Voltage Selection Headers

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW box</span>** indicates the RGB Block header's Jumper is not present, but this header can be used to run fans. Other headers that can be used with fans (as shown by a **<span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE box</span>**) have their Fan Voltage Selections headers which are located below the FAN0, FAN1 and FAN2 connectors. The **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumpers are set for a fan voltage of 24VDC.

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **If fans that use 5VDC or 12VDC are used, please take <span class="color-blind-red">NOTE</span> of these "fan voltage selection headers" and set the jumpers to the appropriate jumper position so that the correct fan voltage will be produced to run the 5VDC or 12VC fan.  If the fan voltage selection jumper is set for 24VDC and a 5VDC/12VDC fan is connected to it, the Fysetc Spider board will be damaged.**

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>** to the right of Z- connector, is the header for setting the PROBE voltage. The **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumper sets the PROBE voltage for 24VDC.  If a PROBE voltage of 5V is desired, this jumper needs to be changed.

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **If the voltage required by the PROBE device does not match the voltage selected by the "probe voltage selection Jumper" then the Fysetc Spider board could be damaged.**

* __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumpers BEFORE the power supply is connected, to ensure these jumpers and wire jumper are set appropriately.**

## Please Ensure the Heat Sinks are Installed Before Use

<span class="color-blind-red">Note on the Orientation of the Stepper Motor Driver's Heat Sinks</span>
: Place the heat sinks for the stepper motor drivers so that the orientation of the fins on the heat sinks are parallel to the air flow from the controller fans once the MCU board is installed on the DIN rail. Ensure the heat sinks are **not touching** the solder joints located on the top of the step stick. Please note, that your placement of heat sinks may be different from the orientation shown below.

## mini 12864 Display

* *spider Rev 1.0 only*: the EXP1 & EXP2 header labels are swapped. Connect  EXP1 (display) to EXP2(spider), and EXP2 (display) to EXP1 (spider).  On the Spider 1.1 or later: connect EXP1->EXP1, and EXP2->EXP2
* *Fysetc mini12864 only*:  components R1 and R4 must be removed from the board before connecting to the Spider.  Note: new displays are shipping with this step already complete, but this should be verified before connecting
* *BTT mini12864 only* remove components R1, and C6, and rotate the connectors 180 degrees

## The Klipper Configuration file for Fysetc Spider V1.0 Board (UART mode - SPI mode needs to be added to this)

The Klipper Configuration file from VoronDesign/Voron-2 GitHub Repo for Fysetc Spider V1.0 board is [located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/Voron2.4/firmware/klipper_configurations/Spider/Voron2_Spider_Config.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation -> Firmware Flashing(Header) -> Fysetc Spider](../../../build/software/spider_klipper#spider-klipper-firmware){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Spider_Config.cfg rename it to printer.cfg and replace UART with SPI). Please see the file [Voron2_Spider_Config.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/Voron2.4/firmware/klipper_configurations/Spider/Voron2_Spider_Config.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a good starting point;

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](../../../build/electrical/Fysetc_Spider_Resources_v1#color-pin-diagram-for-fysetc-spider-v10){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Spider_Config.cfg renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
