# Voron V2 - SKR 2 (TMC2100, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161, TMC5160HV, TMC5160_PRO) Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

We have no idea what state your board is in when you start this process.  Someone could have moved jumpers around already.  But since we are here, on the SPI end of the site, then I assume that you might want to look at the next section **before** removing **all the jumpers** because if all the jumpers are already set for SPI mode then removing them and placing them right back in would be a waste of your valuable time.

**If one does not understand what I mean by "if the jumpers are set for SPI" then I would recommend that removing all the jumpers would be the place to start.**

Remove **all <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW</span>** on-board jumpers, located at the positions shown below:

###### ![](../../../build/electrical/images/SKR2_in_PREP-removal.png) {#SKR2_in_PREP-removal_spi_v2}

## Initial Preparation for SPI Mode - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumpers, located at the positions as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumpers in the diagram below:

## Voltage Selection Headers and Other Headers

* **Set the USB-PWR jumper to the VDD position (as shown in the <span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE box</span>)** to avoid the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* Ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>) are removed**, since the Voron printer does not use sensorless homing.

* In the diagram below, ensure that the "WIFI/UDISK Select" Jumpers (as shown in the **<span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW box</span>**) are set for WIFI to ensure the UDISK port is not connected (both jumpers have an empty pin beneath them).

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumpers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

BAT85
: a Schottky barrier diode. BAT85 is needed to protect the SKR board (MCU board) from being fried.  An inductive probe device (Omron TL-Q5MC2; Omron TL-Q5MC2-Z or Panasonic GX-HL15BI-P) communicates at a much higher voltage level (10V - 30V) then the MCU board.  The BAT85 is used to protect the input signal PIN of the MCU board; without the BAT85 the MCU board will be damaged.  If two BAT85s are used in series, the circuit will protect the MCU board and still allow the inductive probe to function properly.

## Please Ensure the Heat Sinks are Installed Before Use

<span class="color-blind-red">Note on the Orientation of the Stepper Motor Driver's Heat Sinks</span>
: Place the heat sinks for the stepper motor drivers so that the orientation of the fins on the heat sinks are parallel to the air flow from the controller fans once the MCU board is installed on the DIN rail. Ensure the heat sinks are **not touching** the solder joints located on the top of the step stick. Please note, that your placement of heat sinks may be different from the orientation shown below.

## The Klipper Configuration file by TechnoPhreak for SKR 2 board (UART mode - SPI mode needs to be added to this)

The Klipper Configuration file from VoronDesign/VoronUsers TechnoPhreak's GitHub Repo for SKR 2 board is [located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/master/firmware_configurations/klipper/TechnoPhreak/BTT_SKR_v2/printer.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

## URL Resources Links for the SKR 2 (PIN Diagrams and Repo)

* see [The SKR 2 Resource Section](../../../build/electrical/skr2_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please use the Color Pin Diagram displayed here, look for ["Klipper Building Options"](../../../build/electrical/images/SKR_2_V1.0_Colored_PIN_Diagram.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; an alternative source of information on "how to build and install the Klipper firmware for the SKR 2" is at [TechnoPhreak's README file](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/firmware_configurations/klipper/TechnoPhreak/BTT_SKR_v2#user-content-compiler-instructions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (TechnoPhreak's printer.cfg file is already named printer.cfg, but you will need to replace UART with SPI). Please see [the file located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/master/firmware_configurations/klipper/TechnoPhreak/BTT_SKR_v2/printer.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a good starting point;

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](../../../build/electrical/skr2_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
