# Trident - Mellow FLYF407ZG (TMC2100, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161, TMC5160HV, TMC5160_PRO) Wiring

## Initial Removal of Female JST-XH connectors

* Remove **all the JST-XH female connectors from their corresponding sockets.**  When my board arrived all the white female JST-XH connectors were plugged into the male JST-XH sockets.  The diagram below, shows the locations of the pre-installed female JST-XH connectors (as shown by the <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW jumpers</span>).

## Initial Preparation for SPI Mode - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumpers, located at the positions as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumpers in the diagram below:

## End Stop Voltage Selection Header

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE box</span>** indicates the header with **<span class="color-blind-green">a GREEN</span>** jumper which is set for 5VDC.

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **When the FLYboard is shipped the end stop voltage selection header will be empty (i.e., a jumper will not be found here).  One MUST place a jumper on this header, so that the voltage pin in the end stop connectors will carry a charge (X-, X+, Y-, Y+, Z-, Z+, Z3, and DLJC).  The choice is 5VDC or V<sub>in</sub>.  We recommend you set this header to 5VDC.**

* __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumper called out by the _COLORED BOX_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

BAT85
: a Schottky barrier diode. BAT85 is needed to protect the FLYF407ZG board (MCU board) from being fried.  An Inductive Probe device (Omron TL-Q5MC2; Omron TL-Q5MC2-Z or Panasonic GX-HL15BI-P) communicates at a much higher voltage level (10V - 30V) then the MCU board.  The BAT85 is used to protect the input signal PIN of the MCU board; without the BAT85 the MCU board will be damaged.  If two BAT85s are used in series, the circuit will protect the MCU board and still allow the inductive probe to function properly.

## Please Ensure the Heat Sinks are Installed Before Use

## MCU in SPI Mode with Heat Sinks Installed

<span class="color-blind-red">Note on the Orientation of the Stepper Motor Driver's Heat Sinks</span>
: Place the heat sinks for the stepper motor drivers so that the orientation of the fins on the heat sinks are parallel to the air flow from the controller fans once the MCU board is installed on the DIN rail. Ensure the heat sinks are **not touching** the solder joints located on the top of the step stick. Please note, that your placement of heat sinks may be different from the orientation shown below.

## Additional Information Concerning the Mellow FLYF407ZG board

For reference, here is additional information about the Mellow FLYF407ZG board:

1.  If you use a separate (independent power supply), you can replace the USB cable with a direct wire connection to the Raspberry Pi and use UART communications between the FLYF407ZG board and the Raspberry Pi.  Please see [the Mellow FLYF407ZG Raspberry Pi Section](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_RaspberryPi#raspberry-pi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Pinout the ESP-12S which can be used with the FLYF407ZG pre-soldered WIFI socket or via the EXP1 and EXP2 connectors. Please see [the Additional Information Section](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_additional_resources#pin-out-of-esp-12s-wifi-chip){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Pinout the EEPROM 24CO2 Chip which can be used with the FLYF407ZG pre-soldered EEPROM socket. Please see [the Additional Information Section](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_additional_resources#pin-out-of-the-eeprom-chip){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

4. Pinout the MAX6675 Chip which can be used with the FLYF407ZG pre-soldered MAX6675 socket. Also, additional information on K-Type Thermocouples that can be used at T6 connector once a MAX6675 chip is soldered in place.   Please see [the Additional Information Section](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_additional_resources#pin-out-of-the-max6675-chip){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

5. Important information about possible issues with the Mellow FLYF407ZG board.  Please see [the Additional Information Section](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_additional_resources#information-on-issues-with-the-mellow-flyf407zg-board){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation -> Firmware Flashing(Header) -> FLY FLYF407ZG](../../../build/software/flyf407zg_klipper#fly-flyf407zg-klipper-firmware){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file by Antage (printer.ini rename it to printer.cfg and replace UART with SPI). Please see [the file located here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/antage/1976d9df8e8a1126ebbe6f3935145394/raw/6bc4c53194be75a9889fba754ffa61fbb5c7cb89/printer.ini){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a good starting point;

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](../../../build/electrical/flyf407zg_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-mellow-flyf407zg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (printer.ini renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
