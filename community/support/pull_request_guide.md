# Pull Request Guide

The following is a basic guide for creating pull requests for submtting to any of the Voron repositories such as Documentation and UserMods.

1. Create a github user if you don't have one already.
2. Browse to the Voron github repo, either VoronUsers or Voron-Documentation.
3. On the top right, click on 'Fork'.
4. It will process for a few seconds, then return back with a fork of the selected repository.  The owner will no longer be 'Voron Designs', but the user who forked the repository.
5. Make the desired changes to the local / forked repository.  This can be done from the web UI or the command line.
6. Be sure to create a commit.  This actually adds the files to the request.
