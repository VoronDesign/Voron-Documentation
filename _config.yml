# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Set a path/url to a logo that will be displayed instead of the title
# set the logo to use during dark mode - set logo:
logo: "/images/voron_design_logo.png"
logo_dark: "/images/voron_design_logo.png"
# set the logo to use during light mode - set logo-light:
logo_light: "/images/voron_design_logo_light.png"

# Color scheme currently only supports "dark", "light"/nil (default), or a custom scheme that you define
# if you use toggle_color_scheme set color_scheme: dark and set toggle_color_scheme: light
# For the Voron DOCs site, the color_scheme should be set to dark
color_scheme: dark
# To allow a toggle color scheme (also it adds a button to switch all pages) - set toggle_color_scheme: light
# To add a button to switch all pages to a different color scheme use toggle_color_scheme
# For the Voron DOCs site, the toggle_color_scheme should be set to light
toggle_color_scheme: light
# To display the toggle button only on one page - set toggle_page_url: "/"
# To display the toggle button on all pages - set toggle_page_url: nil
# For the Voron DOCs site, the toggle_page_url should be set to nil
toggle_page_url: nil
# To toggle automatically when the system mode preference changes - set toggle_auto_mode: true, 
#    this will allow the user to force the default color mode for the site (i.e. the inital mode will be automatically
#    switched to which ever mode the user has set in OS preferences).  For toggle_auto_mode to work
#    as it should (meaning that the OS preference of light and dark mode has prescendance over the manual mode), so if you have
#    a manual mode switch button present you can temporaially change the mode to the opposite but once you 
#    go to another page on the site or refresh you browser window the mode will switch to the OS preference you
#    set for your system. If you want to switch modes you need to do it on you OS preferences or your system.
#    So the manual button is a temporary switch of mode. Once you are taken to a link off the site the mode will
#    depend on that exteranl web site's setup.
# To toggle the pages manually - set toggle_auto_mode: nil 
#     With toggle_auto_mode set to nil then the OS preference is IGNORED and only the manual selection will 
#     change the mode from dark to light.  the Voron Docs site will always be initially displayed in DARK mode.
#     The User will have to manully switch to the color-blind friendly light mode.  Once the mode is switched it 
#     will persist across web site pages and browser refreshs of the page until you change the mode back. 
#     So the manual button is a persistanct switch of mode. Again, Once you are taken to a link off the site the
#     mode will depend on that external web site's setup.
# For the Voron DOCs site, toggle_auto_mode should be set to nil
toggle_auto_mode: nil
# To set the button text for toggling and reverting - set toggle_text_1 and toggle_text_2
# toggle_text_1 is for light mode
toggle_text_1: "-> Return to the Dark Side"
# toggle_text_2 is for dark mode
toggle_text_2: "-> Color-Blind-Friendly Light Mode"
# Enable or disable the site search
