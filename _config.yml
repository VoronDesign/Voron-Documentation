# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Color scheme supports "dark", "light", and your custom schemes:
# color_scheme will be the color_scheme that will be the initial color scheme if toggle_auto_mode is nil
# If toggle_auto_mode is true, then the initial color scheme will be set by a window.matchMedia() and the
# users OS prference will be the initial color scheme.

# Color scheme supports "dark", "light", and your custom schemes:
# color_scheme: nil                # default: light
color_scheme: dark                 # default: light
# To add a button to switch all pages to switch color modes between color_scheme and toggle_color_scheme modes:
toggle_color_scheme: light         # default: nil (no toggle button)
# To display the toggle button only on one page:
toggle_page_url: nil               # default: nil (display on all pages)

# To toggle automatically when the system mode preference changes - set toggle_auto_mode: true,
#    this will allow the user to force the default color mode for the site (i.e. the inital mode will be automatically
#    switched to which ever mode the user has set in OS preferences).  For toggle_auto_mode to work
#    as it should (meaning that the OS preference of light and dark mode has prescendance over the manual mode), so if you have
#    a manual mode switch button present you can temporaially change the mode to the opposite but once you
#    go to another page on the site or refresh you browser window the mode will switch to the OS preference you
#    set for your OS. If you want to switch modes you need to do it on you OS preferences or your system.
#    So the manual button is a temporary switch of mode. Once you are taken to a link off the site the mode will
#    depend on that exteranl web site's setup.
# To toggle the pages manually - set toggle_auto_mode: nil
#     With toggle_auto_mode set to nil then the OS preference is IGNORED and only the manual selection will
#     change the mode from dark to light.  This web site will always be initially displayed in the mode set by color_scheme.
#     The User will have to manully switch to the toggle_color_scheme mode.  Once the mode is switched it
#     will persist across web site pages and browser refreshs of the page until you change the mode back.
#     So the manual button is a persistanct switch of mode. Again, Once you are taken to a link off site the
#     mode will depend on that external web site's setup.
toggle_auto_mode: nil               # default: nil (manual toggle)

# To set the button text for toggling and reverting:
# toggle_text_1 is for light color scheme
toggle_text_1: "-> Return to the Dark Side"             # default: "-> Dark Mode"
# toggle_text_2 is for dark color scheme
toggle_text_2: "-> Color-Blind-Friendly Light Mode"     # default: "-> Light Mode"
