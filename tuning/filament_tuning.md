# Filament Tuning

Steps and guides for getting filament printing just right.

This process should be run with every brand and type of filament, and potentially even between different colors as pigment can affect filament performance.

Some slicers (such as SuperSlicer) have a number of these process steps built-in.  This can make the process much simpler.

## Temperature

The first step with any process is to identify the ideal temperature for the filament.  The most common process is to print a temperature tower.  A temperature tower help identify the ideal temperature for a filament.

Take note - with enclosures, some filaments such as PLA may need to have the doors opened and the exhaust fan running (and even the sides removed) in order to keep the enclosure cool enough.  Be sure to experiement with your setup.
