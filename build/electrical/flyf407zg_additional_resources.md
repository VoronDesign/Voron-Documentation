### Information on ISSUES with the Mellow FLYF407ZG Board

* This information was obtained from [here](https://teamgloomy.github.io/fly_407zg_general.html#issues){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

* It is recommended that two components for the Mellow FLYF407ZG Board have heat sinks installed.  The board I received from Mellow did not have heat sinks supplied inside the package, but you can buy some from [Amazon here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082RWXFR2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

###### ![](./images/fly_407zg_heatsinks.jpg) {#fly_407zg_heatsinks-1}

* Some boards shipped are missing the bootloader.  If your board has the Mellow logo on the back and when you place a firmware.bin file on the SD card and it doesn't get converted, then yours is one of these boards.

* Information on boot modes for a STM32F407 board:
