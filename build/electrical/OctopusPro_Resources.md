## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?<span> <br> </span>
<span> <br> </span>

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to compile and install the Klipper Firmware, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index.md#software-installation)

2. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to edit the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Octopus_Config.cfg) to ensure your Voron build matches your Klipper Config file, please see [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration.md#software-configuration).  Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed above](#color-pin-diagram-for-btt-octopus-pro-v10), as a source of information.

3. After editing the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Octopus_Config.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index.md#initial-startup-checks)
