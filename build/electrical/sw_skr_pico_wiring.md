# Voron Switchwire - SKR Pico V1.0 Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

* The BTT SKR Pico will arrive without any jumpers being set.

## Initial Preparation - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumper, located at the position as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumper in the diagram below:

## Voltage Selection Header and Other Headers

* Ensure the **removal of the SW_USB 5V power supply jumper ("SW_USB header, shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>")** which avoids the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* In the diagram below, ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE boxes</span>) are removed** to avoid the influence of TMC2209 DIAG on the endstops.

* **Set the SELECT-PROXIMITY-I/O-PIN jumper (shown in the <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW box</span>).**  This SELECT-PROXIMITY-I/O-PIN jumper selects which connector uses IO22 pin (either connector PS or PROBE). Even tho the Voron printer does not use the dedicated PROBE connector for its proximity sensor (inductive probe), set this jumper for the PROBE connector.

* Ensure the **removal of the SELECT-PROXIMITY-STYLE jumper (shown in the <span class="color-blind-red">RED box</span>).** Since the Voron printer does not use the dedicated probe connector, ensure this header is empty.

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumper is set appropriately (and the other jumpers are removed), especially the headers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

* if using UART (3-wire serial communication) with Pi:
    1. - [ ] [complete the steps for setting up UART Serial communications with the Raspberry Pi](./skr_pico_RaspberryPi#raspberry-pi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
    2. - [ ] Connect UART serial cable to the SKR Pico board, but do not connect it yet to your Raspberry Pi

BAT85
: a Schottky barrier diode. BAT85 is needed to protect the SKR board (MCU board) from being fried.  An Inductive Probe device (Omron TL-Q5MC2; Omron TL-Q5MC2-Z or Panasonic GX-HL15BI-P) communicates at a much higher voltage level (10V - 30V) then the MCU board.  The BAT85 is used to protect the input signal PIN of the MCU board; without the BAT85 the MCU board will be damaged.  If two BAT85s are used in series, the circuit will protect the MCU board and still allow the inductive probe to function properly.

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please use the [ Color Pin Diagram, look for "Klipper Building Options"](./images/SKR_PICO_V1.0_Color_PIN_diagram.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; an alternative source of information on how to build and install the Klipper firmware for the SKR Pico is [located here](https://github.com/bigtreetech/SKR-Pico/blob/master/Klipper/README.md#user-content-build-firmware-image){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or the [picture of the menu config screen for Klipper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigtreetech/SKR-Pico/master/Klipper/Images/klipper_menuconfig.png){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create** the Klipper Config file (create a printer.cfg file);

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](./skr_pico_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-pico){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information.

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating** the Klipper Config file (printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
