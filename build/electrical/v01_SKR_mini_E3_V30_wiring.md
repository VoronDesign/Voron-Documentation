# Voron V0.1 - SKR mini E3 V3.0 Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

* There is only **one jumper** on the SKR mini E3 V3.0 board. This jumper is called "Neo-PWR1" jumper.  See the next section about this jumper.

## Initial Preparation - Set Jumper

* The **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN Neo-PWR1 jumper</span>** setting will decide the source of the SKR's 5V rail. The board's 5V rail can be sourced from the board itself or from an external DCDC bridge module.  One can purchase an external DCDC bridge module (sold separately) to power 5V NeoPixel LEDs.  This bridge module is called the "DCDC Mode V1.0" board. Since the Voron printer does not require the extra DCDC bridge module, **set the Neo-PWR1 jumper** so that the board's 5V rail will be powered by the MCU (as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumper in the diagram below).

## USB Voltage Selection Header and Other Headers

* Ensure the **removal of the SW_USB 5V power supply jumper ("SW_USB header, shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>")** which avoids the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* Ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE boxes</span>) are removed** to avoid the influence of TMC2209 DIAG on the endstops.

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumper is set appropriately (and the other jumpers are removed), especially the headers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

## Raspberry Pi

## Power
* The BTT SKR mini E3 V3.0 board is **NOT capable of providing 5V power** to run your Raspberry Pi.

## Setting up UART Serial Communications with the Raspberry Pi

## The Klipper Configuration file for SKR mini E3 V3.0 Board

The Klipper Configuration file from VoronDesign/Voron-0 GitHub Repo, Voron0.1 branch for SKR mini E3 V3.0 board is [located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/Voron0.1/Firmware/skr-mini-E3-v3.0.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

## URL Resources Links for the SKR mini E3 V2.0 (PIN Diagrams and Repo)

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please use the [Color Pin Diagram displayed here, look for "Klipper Building Options"](./images/SKR_mini_E3_V3.0_Color_PIN_diagram_300.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; an alternative source of information on how to build and install the Klipper firmware for the SKR mini E3 V3.0 is [located here](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3/tree/master/firmware/V3.0/Klipper#user-content-build-firmware-image){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (skr-mini-E3-v3.0.cfg rename it to printer.cfg) to ensure your Voron build matches your Klipper Config file, please see [the file located here; Select "V0 SKR mini e3 3.0"](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](./mini_e3_v30_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-mini-e3-v30){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (skr-mini-E3-v3.0.cfg renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
