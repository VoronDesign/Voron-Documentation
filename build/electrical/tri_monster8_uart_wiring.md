# Trident - MKS Monster 8 V1.0 (TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225, TMC2226) Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

* Remove **all <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW</span>** on-board jumpers, located at the positions shown below.

###### ![](./images/Monster8v10_PREP-removal.png) {#Monster8v10_PREP-Removal_UART_tri}

## Initial Preparation - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumpers, located at the positions as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>** jumpers in the diagram below:

## USB-PWR Selection Header and DIAG Headers

* **Set the USB-PWR jumper to off (as shown in the <span class="color-blind-red">RED box</span>)** to avoid the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* Ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE box</span>) are removed** to avoid the influence of TMC2209 DIAG on the endstop.

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumpers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

## (FAN & Endstop/PROBE & DRIVER IC) Voltage Selection Headers

* In the diagram below, the **COLORED BOXES** indicate the headers with **<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>** jumpers that will be discussed next.

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>** indicates the "fan voltage selection headers" with **<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>** jumpers which are set for 24VDC.

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **If fans that use 5VDC or 12VDC are used, please take <span class="color-blind-red">NOTE</span> of these "fan voltage selection headers" and set the jumpers to the appropriate jumper position so that the correct fan voltage will be produced to run the 5VDC or 12VC fan.  If the fan voltage selection jumper is set for 24VDC and a 5VDC/12VDC fan is connected to it, the Monster 8 board will be damaged.**

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE box</span>** indicates the "end stop voltage selection header" with a **<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>** jumper which is set for V<sub>in</sub> or 24VDC. Since the PROBE voltage will be connected to the Z+ end stop connector, the end stop voltage selection header can also be referred to as the PROBE voltage selection header.  If a PROBE voltage of 5VDC is desired, "end stop voltage selection" jumper needs to be changed.

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **If the voltage required by the PROBE device does not match the voltage selected by the "end stop voltage selection Jumper" then the Monster 8 board could be damaged.**

* In the diagram below, the **<span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW box</span>** indicates the DRIVER IC power selection header with **<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>** jumper which is set for 5VDC.  Each stepper motor driver uses a digital logic level to communicate with the Monster 8's STM32 processor. **This jumper MUST BE SET or the stepper motor drivers will not work!**  Since the Voron printers do not use sensorless homing, set this jumper to 5VDC.  You can find more information about this jumper setting by reading page 12 of [this document](<./images/MKS MONSTER8 V1.0 datasheet (based on Klipper firmware to configure Voron 2.4 machine).pdf#page=12>){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

    * __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **If the DRIVER IC power selection jumper is NOT SET, all the stepper motor drivers will not work!**

* **As shown in the <span class="color-blind-red">RED box</span>, set the I<sup>2</sup>C Bus selection jumper to EEPROM/I<sup>2</sup>C** to allow the EEPROM to use the I<sup>2</sup>C bus lines instead of the CAN connector. Refer to the Monster 8 schematic, for [more information about this setting](<./images/MKS Monster8 V1.0_003 SCH.pdf#page=2>){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

* __<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumpers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

BAT85
: a Schottky barrier diode. BAT85 is needed to protect the Monster 8 board (MCU board) from being fried.  An Inductive Probe device (Omron TL-Q5MC2; Omron TL-Q5MC2-Z or Panasonic GX-HL15BI-P) communicates at a much higher voltage level (10V - 30V) then the MCU board.  The BAT85 is used to protect the input signal PIN of the MCU board; without the BAT85 the MCU board will be damaged.  If two BAT85s are used in series, the circuit will protect the MCU board and still allow the inductive probe to function properly.

## Please Ensure the Heat Sinks are Installed Before Use

<span class="color-blind-red">Note on the Orientation of the Stepper Motor Driver's Heat Sinks</span>
: Place the heat sinks for the stepper motor drivers so that the orientation of the fins on the heat sinks are parallel to the air flow from the controller fans once the MCU board is installed on the DIN rail. Ensure the heat sinks are **not touching** the solder joints located on the top of the step stick. Please note, that your placement of heat sinks may be different from the orientation shown below.

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please use the above Color Pin Diagram, look for "How To Compile the [Klipper Firmware for MKS Monster 8 V1.0"](./images/MKS_Monster8-V1.0-color-PIN.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or an alternative source for instructions on how to compile the klipper firmware for the MKS Monster 8 V1.0 board - [See the README file](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Monster8/tree/main/klipper%20firmware#user-content-to-compile-for-klipper-firmware){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Monster8_Config.cfg rename it to printer.cfg). Please see [the file by RealDeuce is located here ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/master/firmware_configurations/klipper/RealDeuce/MKS-Makerbase/Monster8_v1.0_003/Voron2_Monster8_Config.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](./monster8_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-mks-monster-8-v10){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_Monster8_Config.cfg renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
