# Voron V0.1 - SKR Pico Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

* The BTT SKR Pico will arrive without any jumpers being set.

## Initial Preparation - Set Jumpers

* **All** Jumpers should be **removed** from the SKR Pico board.

## Voltage Selection Header and Other Headers

* Ensure the **removal of the SW_USB 5V power supply jumper ("SW_USB header, shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>")** which avoids the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* In the diagram below, ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-orange">ORANGE boxes</span>) are removed** to avoid the influence of TMC2209 DIAG on the endstops.

* Ensure the **removal of the SELECT-PROXIMITY-I/O-PIN jumper (shown in the <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW box</span>).**  This SELECT-PROXIMITY-I/O-PIN jumper selects which connector uses IO22 pin (either connector PS or PROBE). Since the Voron printer does not use a proximity sensor (inductive probe), remove the jumper.

* Ensure the **removal of the SELECT-PROXIMITY-STYLE jumper (shown in the <span class="color-blind-red">RED box</span>).** Since the Voron printer does not use a probe device, ensure this header is empty.

### The Klipper Configuration file for SKR Pico board
<span> <br> </span>
The Klipper Configuration file from VoronDesign/Voron-0 GitHub Repo, Voron0.1 branch for SKR Pico board is [located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/Voron0.1/Firmware/skr-pico-v1.0.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please use the [ Color Pin Diagram, look for "Klipper Building Options"](./images/SKR_PICO_V1.0_Color_PIN_diagram.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; an alternative source of information on [how to build and install the Klipper firmware for the SKR Pico is located here](https://github.com/bigtreetech/SKR-Pico/tree/master/Klipper#how-to-use-klipper-on-skr-pico-v10){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}


3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (skr-pico-v1.0.cfg rename it to printer.cfg) to ensure your Voron build matches your Klipper Config file, please see [the file located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/Voron0.1/Firmware/skr-pico-v1.0.cfg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](./skr_pico_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-pico){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information.

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (skr-pico-v1.0.cfg renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
