# Voron V2 - SKR V1.3 (TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225, TMC2226) Wiring

## Initial Removal of Jumpers

Remove **all <span class="color-blind-yellow">YELLOW</span>** on-board jumpers, located at the positions shown below:

###### ![](./images/SKR_V1.3_PREP-Removal_150.png) {#SKR_V13_PREP-Removal_UART1}

## Initial Preparation - Set Jumpers

* Set the on-board jumpers, located at the positions as shown by the **<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>** jumpers in the diagram below:

## Voltage Selection Header and Other Headers

* **Set the USB-PWR jumper to the INT position (as shown in the <span class="color-blind-purple">PURPLE box</span>)** to avoid the interaction between the USB 5V of Raspberry Pi and the DC-DC 5V of the motherboard.

* Ensure **all of "DIAG Jumpers" or "ST Jumper Block" (shown in the <span class="color-blind-blue">BLUE box</span>) are removed** to avoid the influence of TMC2209 DIAG on the endstop.

__<span class="underline-double-trouble color-blind-red">IMPORTANT:</span>__ **Double check all the** __<span class="color-blind-green">GREEN</span>__ **jumpers are set appropriately, especially the jumpers called out by the _COLORED BOXES_, BEFORE the power supply is connected.**

BAT85
: a Schottky barrier diode. BAT85 is needed to protect the SKR board (MCU board) from being fried.  An Inductive Probe device (Omron TL-Q5MC2; Omron TL-Q5MC2-Z or Panasonic GX-HL15BI-P) communicates at a much higher voltage level (10V - 30V) then the MCU board.  The BAT85 is used to protect the input signal PIN of the MCU board; without the BAT85 the MCU board will be damaged.  If two BAT85s are used in series, the circuit will protect the MCU board and still allow the inductive probe to function properly.

## Please Ensure the Heat Sinks are Installed Before Use

<span class="color-blind-red">Note on the Orientation of the Stepper Motor Driver's Heat Sinks</span>
: Place the heat sinks for the stepper motor drivers so that the orientation of the fins on the heat sinks are parallel to the air flow from the controller fans once the MCU board is installed on the DIN rail. Ensure the heat sinks are **not touching** the solder joints located on the top of the step stick. Please note, that your placement of heat sinks may be different from the orientation shown below.

## After I have Wired up the MCU Board, What Comes Next?

1. Once the MCU board is wired up and wire management has been performed, the next step is to install Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation](../../build/software/index#software-installation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

2. Once Mainsail/Fluidd or Octoprint has been installed, the next step is to **compile and install** the Klipper Firmware, please see [The Build ═► Software Installation -> Firmware Flashing(Header) -> SKR 1.3](../../build/software/skr13_klipper#skr-1314-klipper-firmware){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3. Once the MCU board has the Klipper Firmware Installed, the next step is to **create/edit** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_SKR_13_Config.cfg rename it to printer.cfg) to ensure your Voron build matches your Klipper Config file, please see [the file located here; Select "V2 SKR 1.3"](../../build/software/configuration#initial-voron-printer-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"};

    * Please use the Color PIN Diagrams, [displayed here](./skrv13_Resources#color-pin-diagram-for-skr-v13){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as a source of information;

    * Please consult [The Build ═► Software Configuration](../../build/software/configuration#software-configuration){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on how to edit the Klipper Config file.

4. After **creating/editing** the Klipper Config file (Voron2_SKR_13_Config.cfg renamed to printer.cfg), the next step is to check all the Motors and the mechanics of the Voron printer, please see [The Build ═► Initial Startup Checks](../../build/startup/index#initial-startup-checks){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
