# The Build

This guide contains all the the steps to go from a pile of parts to a functioning printer with a known working configuration.

Please read the guide carefully, there are many details that seem trivial but are included because one or more people got stuck at these points. We as a community want to make sure that everyone has the best experience possible. If you find something confusing and would like clarification, that likely means someone else in the past or future will also find it difficult. Please reach out and we will gladly update the document!

This guide designed to be a "universal" setup guide that can be used across all printers in the Voron lineup. If you are building a printer and there is a section marked for a different printer, that section can be skipped.
